# 🧠 LLM Prompt Optimizer — JSON ➜ TOON Converter

LLM Prompt Optimizer is a Python-based tool that converts traditional JSON data into **TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation)** — a compact, token-efficient format designed for Large Language Models (LLMs).  
It helps developers minimize token usage and API costs when communicating with AI systems.

## 🧠 Concept Overview
TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation) is a newer data representation format optimized for token efficiency.  
This project bridges JSON and TOON — making it easier for developers and AI systems to communicate with lower costs and reduced token usage.

The system:
1. Takes structured JSON input  
2. Converts it into TOON format  
3. Calculates token counts and estimated API costs for comparison
